# Summary:
This project is an educational experimental project and not a final project.
This project produces knowledge and abilities in the following subjects:
*-Planning a project on a new and unfamiliar topic.*

*-Understanding electric circuits.*

*-Introduction to libraries for sensors, motors and screens.*

*-Knowing the different components in the project.*

*-Loop thinking.*

*-Improving CPP capabilities.*

*-Practice and improve soldering skills.*

In the project I created a car from Arduino compatible components, I built the car and the remote control.
Programming the remote control and the car and in addition finding an application that transmits via bluetooth in order to communicate with the bluetooth component of the car.

# The car:
**component:**
-2 dc motors.

-motor driver.

-servo motor.

-ultrasonic sensor.

-hc05 blutetooth module.

-arduino uno.

-battery box.

-LEDs.

# The remote:
**component:**

-oled screen.

-joystick.

-push buttons.

-arduino uno.

-hc05 bluetooth module.

# Libraries:
servo - https://github.com/arduino-libraries

hc05 comunication - 'SoftwareSerial.h'.

motor action - https://github.com/AndreaLombardo/L298N

remote screen - https://github.com/arduino-libraries/TFT/tree/master

# phone app:
Regarding the application - there are many free applications that facilitate connection with the Bluetooth module and communication with it.

# challenges:
This is one of the first projects I started soldering on, so it was one of the challenges.
Another challenge was the initialization and configuration of the Bluetooth modules and creating the communication between them.
In addition, putting the values ​​of the car and the various modes into the screen of the remote was quite a communication challenge.
